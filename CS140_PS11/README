We used the following command line code to run our program:
% javac Build.java
% java Build infile.txt outfile.txt
Dimensions and Build need to be in the same directory
Specify input and output text (.txt) files when running the Build class in the package.
The input file should contain:
First line = number of types of blocks
The following lines = the three dimensions of each type of blocks available
The output file provided should be empty
